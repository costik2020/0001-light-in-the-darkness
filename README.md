**This is a small project which expresses the idea of light vs darkness**

The idea was that when the user will hoover over a box,
the box will light up giving a nice shining effect.

To create this light effect I used this core features:
- Event listeners such as: `mouseover`, `mouseout`
- Dynamic JavaScript with `Node.style` property
- The `transition` css property.



Here is a quick glance on how the project looks like:
